This repository holds the code of the Image-enhanced Knowledge-Aware Hierarchical Attention Network (I-KAHAN) for fake news detection on Social Media. It was developed as part of the TDT4900 Master's Thesis course in Computer Science at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). 

The I-KAHAN architecture and code base are highly based on that of KAHAN described in the paper [_KAHAN: Knowledge-Aware Hierarchical Attention Network for Fake News detection on Social Media_](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3487553.3524664) by Yu-Wun Tseng, Hui-Kuo Yang, Wei-Yao Wang, and Wen-Chih Peng.
